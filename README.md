## Raytracing From The Ground Up, but in Python

This is my work for the book raytracing from the ground up. The original code has been made for cpp with OOP. To test out the code for myself I am currently converting this to Python, mostly to make sure I can't directly copy paste code.

This does make that it is a rather messy project for now, especially since I am still learning myself. 

Eventually I might transfer the project to other languages, if it is able to hold my interest.
